<p>Born February 5, 1985</p>
<p>
<h3 class="font-player">
    At the age of 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager Laszlo Boloni, who was
    impressed by his dribbling. He later became the first player to play in all of Sporting's age groups (U-16, U-17,
    U-18, B-Team, First-Team) all within one season. On 29 September 2002, he played his first match for the first team
    in the domestic league against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored his first two goals against Moreirense in their
    3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gerard
    Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsene Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met him
    at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.
    At the age of 15, Ronaldo was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that almost forced him to give up football.
    But after undergoing successful surgery, he returned to playing football normally. In November 2002, Ronaldo was
    invited to the training ground of the English club Arsenal, London Colney, to answer the invitation of French coach
    Arsene Wenger and his coaching staff. Wenger, who was interested in signing the midfielder, had arranged to meet
    Ronaldo's representatives (he suggested him to Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier) and a transfer was discussed in
    the following months, but the club's manager was interested.Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of
    2003, when Sporting FC defeated Man United 3–1 in the opening match at its Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon. After
    Manchester United players were impressed by Ronaldo's performance, they urged coach Ferguson to sign him to succeed
    the departure of their famous star, English winger David Beckham, to Real Madrid.
